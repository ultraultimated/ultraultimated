### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Neel Parikh. I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. In the past I have worked with Turf Management Team at Bayer Crop Sciences. I was involved primarily in automating the process of Imagery Analysis using Image Processing and Computer Vision techniques. I also worked with Cyabge Software Private Limited as a Software Engineer where I worked upon migrating Monolithic applications to Microservice based architecture using Spring-boot, ActiveMQ and Java in Travel and Hospitality Industry project. Moreover, I was involved in Unit testing and Integration testing of a project in Digital Advertising Domain. My primary interest lies in Software Development and various technologies that surround it. I consider myself as a polyglot who can work on multiple technology stacks with ease. You can find more about my projects and coursework [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neelnparikh/).
